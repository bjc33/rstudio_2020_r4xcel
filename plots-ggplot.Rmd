## Plots with ggplot2

We are going to make plots in R using the ggplot2 package from the tidyverse.


## Methods:
We will install these **packages**

 - **tidyverse** : suite of packages for wrangling and viz with ggplot
 - **readxl** : to read in Excels into R
 - **here** : to help with filepath syntax

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # install.packages("tidyverse")
library(readxl) # install.packages("readxl")
library(here) # install.packages("here")



```
